# README for compiling MINEOS and idagrn6 FORTRAN codes
# 
After installing gfortran (which also requires XCode):

----- STEP 1 -----
Open makeall.sh and edit the 3 variables at the top of the script
1) COMPILER - specifies the compiler. I have only tested gfortran
2) LIBPATH - path to the gfortran library. It should work if you point to
			the ./libgfortran directory
3) BINPATH - path to the output binaries.

----- STEP 2 -----
To compile everything, open the terminal and type: 
sudo ./makeall.sh

If everything works, these files should be in the bin directory:

draw_frechet_gv       frechet_cvG           idagrn6_mask
draw_frechet_gv_perc  frechet_cv_ms         idagrn6_sac
eig_recover           frechet_cv_perc       idagrn6_sac_excite
eigenST_asc           frechet_gv            mineos_nohang
frechet               frechet_psi           mineos_qcorrectphv
frechet_ACFLN_love    get_eigfxn_grvelo     mineos_strip
frechet_Q             get_eigfxn_grvelo_int mineos_table
frechet_cv            idagrn6_excite        plot_wk

There are three files that can run make for you: makeall_linux.sh, 
makeall_M2chip.sh, and makeall.sh. With an Intel Mac Sonoma 14.4.1,
I (Brennan Brunsvik) actually had to use makeall_M2chip.sh. The normal 
makeall.sh resulted in plot_wk giving a memory reference error, even though
I do not have an M chip.  

----- STEP 3 ----- *
The bin folder containing the fortran executables must be added to your 
path. To do this, open ~/.profile and enter the following:

export PATH="path/to/bin:$PATH"

*(This should be done automatically in the MATLAB script now, but I would 
still recommend this step anyway)

----- Additional steps -----
You should have brewermap for some of the plots to work. This is added 
to the path in a2_mk_kernels.m.
